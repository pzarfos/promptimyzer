**Trains** is now **ClearML**.

## Version 0.11.3

### Trains

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Resource-Monitor will only monitor active GPU devices based on environment variables: `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` or `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.
* Fix issue ([GitHub Issue #48](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/issues/48)).

## Version 0.11.2

### Trains

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Fix Python 2.7 support.
* Improve sample code Windows support.

## Version 0.11.1

### Trains

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Embed GPU Monitoring into **Trains** (removed gpustat dependency).
* Add initial support for TensorFlow v2.0 (tested with v2.0.0rc1).
* Add artifact upload retry on network errors (default: 3).
* Suppress urllib3 retry warnings.
* Fix Matplotlib support with Agg backend (multiple plot windows caused repeated graphs to be sent).
* Fix support for tuples in hyperparameters.
* Fix multi processing issues with different task types.

## Version 0.11.0

### Trains

**Features and Bug Fixes**

* Full artifacts support (supported by trains-server >= 0.11.0).
* Artifacts include, Pandas.DataFrame, Numpy, PIL Image, local files, and local folder / wildcard ([example](https://github.com/allegroai/trains/blob/master/examples/reporting/artifacts.py)).
* Artifacts support for folder / wildcard, selected files will be zipped and uploaded.
* Resource monitoring, remove sensor reading failure warnings.

**Breaking Changes**

* Logger `info`/`error`/`warning`/`console` functions were removed, use `Logger.report_text` (or Python logging or print instead).
* TensorBoard scalars are not grouped into one graph, but are stored on individual graphs (to match TensorBoard behavior). 
  To restore previous behavior call: `Logger.tensorboard_auto_group_scalars(group_scalars=True)`.

### Trains Server

* Add scalar graphs smoothing (matched TensorBoard behavior).
* Add scalar graphs X-axis selection: Iteration / Relative / Wall Time.
* Add min / max / last value for all scalars (available in experiment table column selection / sorting).
* Add hyperparameter to experiment table custom columns.
* Add artifacts support (Models tab moved into artifacts as specific artifact type).
* Add full Azure storage support.
* Fix column sorting N/A values.
